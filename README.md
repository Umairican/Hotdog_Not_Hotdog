### Problem Statement
 
The goal of this project is to train a convolutional neural network model with Keras to reliably distinguish if an image is a hotdog, or not a hotdog. With some luck, it may even be able to answer the age-old question of whether or not a hotdog is a sandwich.


### Executive Summary



### Data

The images were taken from this [dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yashvrdnjain/hotdognothotdog).


### Additional Resources

The idea for this is taken directly from "Silicon Valley". As Jian-Yang, visionary creator of such a profound app, has inspired me, I have decided to use machine learning to recreate the App and see if we can determine if an image is a hotdog, or not a hotdog.

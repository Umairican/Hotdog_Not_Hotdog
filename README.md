# Hotdog_Not_Hotdog
Computer Vision Project For Determining if an image is a hotdog, or not a hotdog, based on the brilliant App idea from Jian-Yang on "Silicon Valley".



---


### Problem Statement
 
The goal of this project is to train a convolutional neural network model with Keras to reliably distinguish if an image is a hotdog, or not a hotdog. With some luck, it may even be able to answer the age-old question of whether or not a hotdog is a sandwich.

We are attempting to see if the model performs better than blindly guessing (50/50 in binary classification).


### Executive Summary

Using convolutional neural networks with Max Pooling layers, we have managed to achieve an accuracy of 70% with our model. I have deployed this model on Streamlit to be tested, which takes uploaded images and returns a percentage response for whether or not the model believes it is looking at a hotdog. Test it out and see what results you get!

### Data

The images were taken from this [dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yashvrdnjain/hotdognothotdog).


### Additional Resources

The idea for this is taken directly from "Silicon Valley". As Jian-Yang, visionary creator of such a profound app, has inspired me, I have decided to use machine learning to recreate the App and see if we can determine if an image is a hotdog, or not a hotdog.
